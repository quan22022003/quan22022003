## Projects

### Machine Learning/Data Analysis
- [Modeling Esophagael Cancer from a Bayesian Perspective](https://github.com/quan22022003/Bayesian-Analysis-of-Esophageal-Cancer-Risk-Factors) - Modeling the probability of developing Esophagael Cancer with Bayesian Linear Logistic Regression method. Achieved an accuracy of 80%.
- [Modelling Creditability: A Bayesian Approach](https://github.com/quan22022003/Modelling-Creditability-A-Bayesian-Approach) - Modelling Creditability of Customers from a German bank with Bayesian Logistic Regression method. Achieved a precision of 81%.
- [Predictive Modeling for Sleep Efficiency](https://github.com/quan22022003/Predictive-Modeling-for-Sleep-Efficiency-Using-Machine-Learning) - Modeling Sleep Effiency with Linear Regression method. Achieved a low Mean-square Error of 0.027.

### Database Management
- [Vaccine Distribution](https://github.com/quan22022003/Vaccine-Distribution/blob/main/README.md) - A database built to keep track of the different vaccine types, transportation of vaccine batches, treatment plans, staff schedules of vaccination events, and patient data for Corona vaccine distribution and treatment in Finland.

### Decision Analysis/Operations Research
- [Application of Multi-attribute Value Theory in Purchasing Plane Ticket](https://github.com/quan22022003/decision-making-project) - A project aimed to solve a decision problem - deciding which plane ticket to buy - by employing Multi-Attribute Value Theory (MAVT) and value-focused thinking approach.

### Web Development
- [Quýt Lẹt Application](https://github.com/quan22022003/Drill-and-Practice) - A web application for practicing and managing multiple-choice questions. The application uses a three-tier architecture (client, server, database) and a layered architecture with four layers (views, controllers, services, database). It is built using Deno and Oak and is designed to facilitate learning through repeated practice of course material.
- [Shared Shopping Lists Web Application](https://github.com/quan22022003/shopping-lists-web) -  A web application designed for managing shared shopping lists. Users can create shopping lists, add items to them, mark items as collected, and deactivate shopping lists as needed. The project follows a three-tier architecture (client, server, database) and is organized using a layered architecture with four distinct layers: views, controllers, services, and database.



I am open to opportunities so please feel free to reach out.
